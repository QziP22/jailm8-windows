Now stores the backend within the GUI executable, so it doesn't have to be downloaded
Switched to G++ for compilation, allowing ^^ to happen
Now checks if the GUI is saved as jailm8.exe, as that would lead to issues
Added an under-the-hood cmd window, so you can manually fix crashes and freezes if needed
Now logs all backend output to the background cmd window, allowing you to copy it if needed
Centred OK button in credits box
Reverted credits pop up to the same style as the rest of the GUI
Now uses a cleaner way to save the backend as a resource, making startup quicker even when the backend needs to be extracted
Fixed memory leak when extracting backend
If the backend doesn't exist already, it will be loaded in as a temporary file and deleted later
The terminal log will now show all output as soon as it is returned by jailm8, instead of waiting for the end of the function
Now says "no devices are connected" instead of a blank icon when using the UDID functions
Now shows an error icon in the alert box when encountering certain messages
