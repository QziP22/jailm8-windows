Fixed all the alert box titles being in caps (I have no clue why they're like that)
Added function to check for frontend update too (make sure the exe name doesn't contain spaces)
Renamed App Installer submenu to App Tools
Now prevents the backend from being modified (deleted/renamed) while the gui is running
Fixed issue with ^ not happening when backend is being downloaded
Used cleaner approach to check if backend exists
Minimised memory usage of both cli and gui releases, it maxes at around 12.5 mb, but stays at 7.4 mb when on the menu
Moved both update checkers to a submenu
Added a submenu to see the latest changelog, for both the GUI and CLI version
Now checks for an internet connection from the GUI when the backend can't (for some functions, not all)
Increased max string size for showing output, if any line contains more than 256 character, or the total output of a function is more than 1026, jailm8 will crash
Renamed AMDS option to Apple Mobile Device Support 64, for clarity
