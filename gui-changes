Now shows the changelog when updating the backend
Speed improvements
Added hotkey to see backend version
When running the cli options, it will now show an alert about multiple instances instead of just crashing
Now only works with windows 10 (the backend doesn't play nice with lower versions)
Added submenu for id, date and name, now allowing you to use those functions on network devices as well
Now added support for network devices for most provision and app installer options
Added a few nested submenus (sub-submenus) to keep it neat
Added separators in the menus, to keep things neat and just to change up the look
Added captions in the "Tools" drop-down menu
