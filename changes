CHANGELOG:
added ideviceenterrecovery to the irecovery command, so you can now put your device into recovery mode
now doesn't make a temp file for startup
now uses a simple connection for commands using ideviceinfo, apart from ideviceinfo itself.
It won't auto pair when using recovery now
Also doesn't autopair when using version command
Now allows you to see saved prefs with the "prefs" command
Now checks if there is a prefs file, so doesn't show errors in colour command
