CHANGELOG:
Made exit a bit more graceful
Added the internet check to the amds64 installer
Now doesn't quit the start-up configurator if an invalid command is entered
Renamed the bold colour scheme to hazy
Fixed bug with menu entries not being accepted in the start-up configurator
Now adds an extra blank line after the menu when running a start-up command
Now saves colour scheme and startup config in one prefs file, which is loaded in at startup
Stats would crash with the new prefs file, so the "startup command set" detail was removed
NOTE: if you have set a colour scheme or a start-up command, you will need to clean resources and set them again
fixed empty prefs file appearing
