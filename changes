CHANGELOG:
Now checks for too many arguments first, just to be quicker
Now shows the update texts in the same window as jailm8
Cleaned up startup function
Removed unncessary functions and headers
Speed improvements
Much cleaner code
Reworked how resources are loaded, much more efficient now
Small memory improvements
Grammar corrections
Now shows the multiple instance error as a gui box when the app is not run from cmd
Now doesn't pause when running jailm8 from the wrong directory
Removed jailm8 is being updated text
Now uses standard windows API for a lot more stuff
Added text that shows info when you hover on the .exe
Added ability to send arguments to id, date and name. It will forward them to the libimobiledevice .exe used for the function, use the arg -h for more info

*If you're wondering how all these speed improvements are happening, its due to to HUGE background changes, most of the time by using standard windows api to do stuff mor efficiently
