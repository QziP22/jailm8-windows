CHANGELOG:
Now checks for wifi whenever its needed, instead of just at startup
This means that jailm8 is less vulnerable to crashes and glitches when the wifi status changes while it is running
Iproxy now uses two args as the ports it asks for, E.G. If you want to proxy the ssh server to port 2222, type "jailm8 iproxy 2222 22"
Made jailm8 use the initial wifi test result for the startup functions, so that it doesn't check twice
Made all terminal output green, just cos white looked boring (this won't affect the colour scheming)
Addded colour to lots of the app, where it won't affect the colour scheming
Changed the way colour schemes are applied, you will have to reset the colour scheme for it to work in this release
Colour coded the help text
Made sure the default colours match the jailm8 colour scheme
