CHANGELOG:
Added check-update function to be run from cli interface
Now returns error level 1 if it detects another instance of jailm8
Tried to get the app to return the return value of the actual commands, but its not very reliable
cleaned up exit protocols
sped up running without args
Now doesn't store args in memory if there are too many anyways
Now allows jailm8 to be run as admin without crashing
Now doesn't load futurerestore links if run from the terminal (might be a bit buggy)
When using clisetup, you no longer need to manually copy the script, but you do need admin rights
Added a line in stats regarding admin rights
Removed annoying extra line when running stats from cli
