CHANGELOG:
Removed useless feature in provision for dumping all profiles (from when jailm8 only supported 2 arguments)
Removed loading indicator, jailm8 is way too fast for that now :flex:
EVEN MORE speed improvements, now its soooo fast you might not even see the "starting up..." text
Memory improvements
Now actually returns the exit value of the tool you're using as the jailm8 return value
Now returns 1 for more problems
Can now send unlimited arguments to jailm8!!! (idk what you're gonna do with 1000 arguments but its cool)
Added idevicediagnostics to advanced
Now returns -1 if no device is connected when running info and entering recovery (that needs to be done manually)
General code cleanup
Improved memory limits, now doesn't have any apart from the native windows ones
Moved the colour reset function to the cleanup function (acts the same way, its just better and more reliable)
Now doesn't need to load the links at the beginning, speeding up startup
