CHANGELOG:
re-ordered update sequence so that changes are downloaded first, then jailm8.exe
Now doesn't show the terminate batch job text
Now allows you to exit with control c properly
Now kills all child processes with control c too
Now only kills the one jailm8 instance, although running 2 instances isn't supported at all
Fine tuned ideviceinfo command, now doesn't rely on type and then more, now it only uses more
Now shows percentage scrolled when using ideviceinfo
