CHANGELOG:
Now, instead of disabling jailm8 altogether when wifi isn't connected, jailm8 only disables the options where the required resources haven't been downloaded.
To allow jailm8 to use its tools offline, you have to select your option at least once.
If the menu resource hasn't been downloaded, then it is impossible for any other resource to have been downloaded, so jailm8 is disabled completely.
The update option is also disabled when wifi isn't connected
Added stats command (no menu entry). This shows: Downloaded resources, working directory, jailm8 version, WiFi status, connected devices (if libimobiledevice is downloaded)
Stats command now shows how many files are in the resources folder, it even counts them for you
Updated text shown when a command not run before is run when offline. It now says what option you tried to run instead of just "this option"
Modified the version command, it is no longer part of the menu (so not 19 anymore), but is still available with the version command
Cleaned up some startup functions
