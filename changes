CHANGELOG:
sped and cleaned up the running of all commands that require a download
fine tuned some commands (like id) so much that they are almost instant
Fixed cli paramter irecovery help showing an endless loop
Now resets the colour when exitting jailm8
Moved support to system commands as it doesn't need a menu entry
