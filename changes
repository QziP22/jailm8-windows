CHANGELOG:
now allows sending up to 8 arguments 
re-ordered arg sending, now processes exe name first, and then args
Now prevents multiple instances of jailm8 to be run at the same time, as this caused crashes before
Now reverses a port to the idevice when using iproxy, so you can connect to the ssh server on your computer over usb (port 22 on the computer is proxied to 2222 on the idevice)
Now pauses for a second when "full[y] restart[ing]" to avoid crashes due to overlaps in instances
