CHANGELOG:
Now doesn't prompt you to install amds if you are running it from a command prompt (to stop gui crashing)
Fixed false positive when checking if AMDS64 is installed
Now checks for the actual amds64 files instead of just the folder
Improved memory usage, now only uses as much as it needs
Startup and exit protocols might take a bit longer if your machine doesn't have enough memory
Decreased the memory needed while running (still needs the same memory for startup)
Removed a completely useless utilities that were sitting there doubling the memory usage
Major code re-organisation
Fixed unnecessary cleanup at startup, which also led to memory not being allocated properly
Removed unnecessary functions from cleanup protocols
Added error checks around the app, prevents crashes
Minimised memory leaks
TOTAL MEMORY USAGE DECREASE: 22% (~0.8mb)
