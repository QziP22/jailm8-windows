CHANGELOG:
Fine tuned clisetup to only needing 3 lines, and use a much cleaner approach
Cleaned up several startup functions
Minimised memory usage of both cli and gui releases
Cleaned up exit protocols to be quicker
Now restores the terminal to the colour it was when jailm8 was started, instead of changing the entire console colour
Disabled control c altogether, it was being annoying
Several speed improvements all over the app
