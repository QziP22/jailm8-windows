CHANGELOG:
Fixed the error when updating resources, saying file could not be found when updating android.
Allows you to manually access the Apple Mobile Device Support installer
No longer deletes the Apple Mobile Device Support installer
Adds an advanced help command (help system) only accessible by command (so no menu entry)
Re-ordered the stats info (my OCD wanted all the true/false values together)
Cleaned up clean function, now much smoother, and uses the [Y/N] questions like the rest of the app
Now stops the residual commands appearing when running for most of the app
The main menu screen is now case insensitive, so you can use the command style ui LiKe ThIs If YoU wAnT
Completely rewritten in c (and still uses the same batch functions), so much smaller now. This should also fix the windows defender issues
