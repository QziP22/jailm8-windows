CHANGELOG:
Made sure the menu function is run from the working directory
Cleaned up the way some of the functions work
Now added an option to let you run jailm8 from command prompt anywhere (clisetup)
Allows you to use the ideviceinfo dump function from the cli interface
Cleaned up the way control c works
control c no longer kills all child processes
Now allows creating a new, nested instance of jailm8 by fully restarting
Changed the iproxy command so that it creates a new ssh windows and the iproxy connection simultaneously
Added a loading indicator right at startup (only for running jailm8 without cli args), to allow for finding problems easily
Now outputs all libimobiledevice errors to stdout instead of stderr
Fixed jailm8 hanging at the ascii screen when wifi isn't connected
Format the help texts properly
Fixed menu entry for clean not working as expected
Removed debug option as it wasn't as useful as the others
Added futurerestore by opa instead of debug
