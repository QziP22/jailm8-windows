# jailm8-windows
A multipurpose jailbreak tool for windows

# What is it?
So I had made [jailm8](https://github.com/SarKaa/jailm8), with all its extra features, but I was disappointed by the lack of tools available for windows. I saw that people had to resort to compiling tools themselves with cygwin, which is a horrible experience for some tools (project sandcastle I'm looking at you)

On my discord support server, I was talking about how jailm8 (the iso) would become obsolete when checkra1n for windows is released. Then a friend asked me if I could make a simple tool that would make it easy to set up the same extra features I had in jailm8, but for windows.

Naturally, I looked around, no one had specific tools compiled for windows, everyone expected people to compile them themselves.

I got to work, compiling various different jailbreak tools, and making a small windows app that could run these files. 

# tools included
